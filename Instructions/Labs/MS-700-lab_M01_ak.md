# **Lab 01: Manage Microsoft Teams**

# **Student lab answer key**

## **Microsoft 365 user interface**

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.**

## **Lab Scenario**

In the labs, of this course, you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a Teams Administrator for Contoso Ltd. You are asked to ensure the required Teams admin roles are assigned to your pilot team members and check license assignment to users. As part of the Microsoft Teams rollout in Contoso, you need to make sure the pilot team members are well versed with the usage of Teams admin center, its menus and PowerShell cmdlets to handle day to day administrative tasks. You have implemented Microsoft 365 in a virtualized lab environment already and were commissioned to test the creation Microsoft 365 Groups from the M365 admin center and new teams using Teams desktop and web clients. You will also enable access to explore Teams Preview features using Teams update policy. Once the pilot team completes exploring and testing the features in Teams admin center and Microsoft 365 admin center, you need to guide them to follow best practices in creating and configuring naming and expiration policies for the groups and teams while enforcing the restriction on the creation of teams. 

You have just started the pilot project, and you’ve already got two virtual machines with preinstalled Teams Desktop clients and a tenant with different users:

- Joni Sherman (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Teams administrator**

- Patti Fernandez (PattiF@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Teams device administrator**

- Allan Deyoung (AllanD@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Teams communication support engineer**

- Alex Wilber (AlexW@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Regular pilot user from Canada**

- Lynne Robbins (LynneR@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Regular pilot user**

- Diego Siciliani (DiegoS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com) **Regular pilot user**

## **Objectives**

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Assign Teams admin roles to users

- Check license assignment for users

- Understand the Teams admin center and its menus

- Install the Teams PowerShell module and explore its cmdlets

- Create Microsoft 365 Groups from the M365 admin center

- Create new teams using the Teams desktop client

- Create new teams using the Teams web client

- Enable access to Teams Preview features

## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 100 minutes.

## **Instructions**

### **Before you start**

The labs in this course have been prepared for a Microsoft Teams deployment at Contoso Ltd. Corporation. Contoso is running a Microsoft 365 cloud-only deployment. The lab environments have been specifically designed in this manner to give you experience managing Microsoft Teams in a Microsoft 365 deployment. You will be provided with two virtual machines and a Microsoft 365 tenant to complete the lab steps.

#### **1. Sign in to the lab virtual machines**

The labs in this course will use two virtual machines:

- Client 1 VM: a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

- Client 2 VM: a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

**Note:** Lab virtual machine sign-in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor.

**Important:** The exercises in the MS-700 labs are cloud-only deployments. A local administrator account has been created on the client VMs. You will log into the VMs as a local administrator instead of a domain account. Following your login, the desktop will indicate that you are logged in as either **CLIENT1 or CLIENT2**, depending on which machine you are on.

#### **2. Review installed applications**

Once you signed in to the VM, observe the start menu, and verify following applications have been installed:

- Microsoft Teams

#### **3. Review Microsoft 365 tenant**

Besides two VMs, you will also be provided with a Microsoft 365 tenant with the following highlights:

- Office 365 E5 with Enterprise Mobility + Security E5.

- 15 licenses in total with 5 available of 15(10 used).

- One Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) and 9 standard users have been pre-created.

- **Note:** Microsoft 365 sign-in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor.

- The username of the Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) is **admin@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com**.

- **&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com** - This is the domain associated with the Microsoft 365 tenant that was provided by the lab hosting provider. The first part of this domain name (&lt;YourTenant&gt;) is the unique tenant ID provided by the lab hosting provider. The &lt;YourTenant&gt; portion of the tenant ID, which is the tenant suffix ID, will be unique for each student.

- **IMPORTANT:** This is critical because, throughout this lab, you will be asked to enter the **&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com** domain name when signing into apps with a given username (for example, JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com). When doing so, you must enter the unique tenant suffix ID that is assigned to your tenant ID in place of the **&lt;YourTenant&gt;**.

- For example, if your Tenant Email is **admin@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com**, the unique tenant suffix ID (&lt;YourTenant&gt;) is **contosolab**. When signing in as Joni when entering this domain, you would replace &lt;YourTenant&gt; with contosolab (for example, JoniS@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com).

- **RECOMMENDATION:** You should write down your unique tenant suffix, mentioned as &lt;YourTenant&gt; in this lab and provided by your training provider. After a while, you will have this name or number memorized as you move through the labs in this course.

- **WWL Tenants - Terms of Use**

    If you are being provided with a tenant as a part of an instructor-led training delivery, please note that the tenant is made available for the purpose of supporting the hands-on labs in the instructor-led training. 

    Tenants should not be shared or used for purposes outside of hands-on labs. The tenant used in this course is a trial tenant and cannot be used or accessed after the class is over and are not eligible for extension. 

    Tenants must not be converted to a paid subscription. Tenants obtained as a part of this course remain the property of Microsoft Corporation and we reserve the right to obtain access and repossess at any time.
