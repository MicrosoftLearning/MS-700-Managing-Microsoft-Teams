You have successfully created a new team with the Teams desktop client, by using an existing Microsoft 365 group. Leave the Teams client open and continue with the next task.

#### Task 2 - Create a team by using PowerShell

In this task, you will create via the Teams PowerShell a new team **‚ÄúCA-Office‚Äù**. You will create the public channels **‚ÄúSupport‚Äù** and **‚ÄúRecruiting‚Äù**. Additionally, you will create the private channel **‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù** via Teams PowerShell.
