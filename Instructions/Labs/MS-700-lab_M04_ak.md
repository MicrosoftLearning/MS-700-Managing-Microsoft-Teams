#### Task 2 – Explore Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)

CQD is designed to help Microsoft Teams administrators and network engineers monitor call and meeting quality at an organization-wide level. The near real-time data enables Teams admins to quickly resolve issues by drilling down to find where issues originated, and who was affected.

In this task you navigate to Call Quality Dashboard

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** and browse to Teams admin center ([https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/)) as **Joni Sherman** ([JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com)).

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Analytics & reports** then **Call Quality Dashboard**.

3. A new browser tab with the url [**https://cqd.teams.microsoft.com/**](https://cqd.teams.microsoft.com/) will open. You will be prompted to sign-in, when you access the CQD portal for the first time. Note: If there is an error when the new browser tab opens, simply  type in the browser: https://cqd.teams.microsoft.com/.

4. When you first sign into the CQD Portal, you'll see the summary reports with daily and monthly call quality trends. Call quality is classified as good, poor, or unclassified. 

5. From the **Product Filter** dropdown menu, select **Microsoft Teams**. 

6. Explore the data under different tabs, including Overall Call Quality, Server-Client, Client-Client, and Voice Quality SLA.

In this exercise you have learnt how to access and navigate call analytics and Call Quality Dashboard.
